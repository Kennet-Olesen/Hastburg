                        <p>Magnus was a known trouble maker within the realm of the nine hells, He was always trying to
                            make a mess with the local devil, Most of the time he was not caught due to having friends
                            covering up for the trouble he made, but the devil were having enough with Magnus games.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            he has caused a lot of trouble of the trade routes for the town, the devil kept him as a
                            prisioner, he was given multiple options to reform back into a normal worker for the devil,
                            but magnus refused every time since he wasn't looking for work.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            They spent a long time on disccussing how to punish Magnus, Some were saying that he should
                            just have been hang/executed, but that would be to easy, So they all agreed to having him
                            exiled/banished from the nine hells. Little did they know, this is what he wanted, but he
                            had no idea, that the devil would put up a bounty for him within all the realms of the nine
                            hells, So other demons and teiflings would be hunting for him.
