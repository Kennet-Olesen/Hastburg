                        <p>Kathy is an attractive young woman with thick long auburn hair and brown eyes. She is dressed
                            in travel clothing and a leather top. She is adorned with some simple jewelry. She carries
                            around a shoulder bag, a scroll case and a basket. The only visible weapon is a light
                            crossbow.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            She is a traveling performer who travels from city to city with a raccoon and a horse. She
                            performs her own written plays in the towns centers. She tells her story while her raccoon
                            is the center of the play and acts out the story. She uses costumes, minor magics and
                            backgrounds all to enhance her play. She's quite successful and outside of the big plays she
                            also plays music in bars and taverns to pay for her food and lodging and to promote her
                            plays.
