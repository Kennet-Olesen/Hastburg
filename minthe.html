                        <p>Minthe is a female tabaxi belonging to an old monastic order, the Order of Dados. Itâ€™s a
                            seclusive and theocratic society, comprised of four temples, each hidden away atop mountain
                            ranges. Minthe was born, raised, and educated at the Western Temple of Dados, under the
                            guardianship of the nuns there.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Temple is well known for its medicine. Historically the
                            order was nomadic and still many members chose to go on long journeys, roaming the world as
                            individuals or in small groups. When Minthe reached her majority, she decided to go on one
                            of these journeys herself. She went alone and became a wandering healer, helping the poor
                            and hurt. Minthe is an encouraging and empathetic woman with great compassion for others.
                            She has an avid interest in books and history, particularly in areas pertaining to medicine.
                            Minthe also possesses a strong sense of duty. She is eager to make a difference in the world
                            despite her inexperience. Although her order emphasizes pacifism, Minthe is fierce in her
                            willingness to do whatever is required to maintain balance and peace.
